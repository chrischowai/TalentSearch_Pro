## Arguments Integration

**Task**: ARGUMENTS$

Apply to: store_daddy: Store coverage goals and project constraints

---

## Phase 1: Project Detection & Analysis

**IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for coverage analysis:**
```
"I'll spawn agents for zero-config coverage setup:
- sherlock: Detect project type and existing test framework
- artisan: Analyze uncovered files and missing test patterns
- murphy: Identify dependencies and setup requirements
Let me analyze coverage opportunities in parallel..."
```

## Phase 2: Test Generation & Coverage

**IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for test creation:**
```
"I'll spawn agents for parallel test generation:
- artisan: Create tests for high-impact functions
- artisan: Add error handling and edge case tests
- artisan: Build integration tests for external dependencies
Let me generate essential test coverage in parallel..."
```

## Phase 3: Validation & Optimization

**IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for coverage validation:**
```
"I'll spawn agents to validate coverage improvements:
- artisan: Run coverage analysis and verify targets
- bugsy: Test all new tests pass and work correctly
- murphy: Optimize test setup and CI integration
Let me validate coverage results in parallel..."
```

## Success Criteria

Before marking complete:
- [ ] Project type detected and test framework setup
- [ ] Coverage analysis completed
- [ ] High-impact tests created (80-85% target)
- [ ] All tests pass successfully
- [ ] Coverage commands provided for future use
- [ ] Quick wins identified and implemented

## Coverage Strategy

- Focus on business logic and error handling
- Target 80-85% coverage sweet spot
- Prioritize high-impact areas first
- Store coverage patterns with store_daddy

**Core principle: Quick, practical coverage improvement without over-testing.**
