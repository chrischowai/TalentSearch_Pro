# âš¡ /logging ARGUMENTS$

## Arguments Integration

**Task**: ARGUMENTS$

Apply to: store_daddy: Store debugging goals and logging requirements

---

## Phase 1: Project Discovery

**IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for logging analysis:**
```
"I'll spawn agents for fast logging setup:
- sherlock: Detect project type and existing logging patterns
- artisan: Identify critical error points and failure paths
- murphy: Find logging dependencies and configuration needs
Let me analyze logging requirements in parallel..."
```

## Phase 2: Logging Implementation

**IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for logging setup:**
```
"I'll spawn agents for minimal error tracking:
- artisan: Add structured error logging to critical paths
- artisan: Implement single-line error format for debugging
- bugsy: Test logging works correctly across error scenarios
Let me implement fast error tracking in parallel..."
```

## Phase 3: Validation & Optimization

**IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for logging validation:**
```
"I'll spawn agents to validate logging setup:
- artisan: Test error logging captures necessary context
- bugsy: Verify logs are useful for debugging sessions
- murphy: Optimize logging performance and output format
Let me validate logging effectiveness in parallel..."
```

## Success Criteria

Before marking complete:
- [ ] Project type detected and logging framework chosen
- [ ] Structured error logging added to critical paths
- [ ] Single-line format ready for debugging
- [ ] All logging tested and working correctly
- [ ] Fast issue identification enabled for agents
- [ ] Copy/paste ready format provided

## Logging Strategy

- Focus on critical failure points
- Use structured single-line format
- Enable fast debugging for coding agents
- Store logging patterns with store_daddy

**Core principle: Minimal, fast error tracking for effective debugging.**
