## Simple Commit + Sync Flow

**IMMEDIATELY spawn gitty agent:**
```
"I'll use the gitty agent to create a human-style commit and sync it:
- Generate natural, conversational commit message (no AI robot speak)
- Review staged changes and commit structure
- Commit locally with proper formatting
- Push/sync to remote repository
Let me handle the complete commit + sync process..."
```

## Human-Style Commit Guidelines

**Pass these guidelines to gitty:**

### ‚úÖ Natural Human Style:
- "Fix login timeout issue"
- "Add user delete button"
- "Clean up messy CSS"
- "Handle null case properly"
- "Make mobile buttons actually clickable"

### ‚ùå Avoid AI Robot Speak:
- ~~"Implement comprehensive optimization"~~
- ~~"Leverage enhanced functionality"~~  
- ~~"Utilize advanced methodologies"~~
- ~~"feat: implement comprehensive user interface improvements"~~

### Conversational Tone:
- Write like explaining to a teammate
- "Fix that annoying bug from yesterday"
- "Finally get search working properly"
- "Quick fix for broken tests"
- "Oops, forgot to handle edge case"

## Complete Workflow

**gitty should handle:**
1. Review current staged/unstaged changes
2. Generate human-like commit message based on changes
3. Create commit with natural wording
4. Push/sync to remote repository
5. Confirm successful commit + sync

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Commit message sounds human, not AI-generated
- ‚úÖ Changes are committed locally
- ‚úÖ Changes are synced to remote
- ‚úÖ Ready to move on to next task

**Core principle: Quick, natural commits that let you move forward.**
