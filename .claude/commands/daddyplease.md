## üöÄ Complete Project Building Workflow

**The smartest way to go from idea to working project:**

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project
```
daddy init
```
**What it does:** Sets up project database and creates `daddy_project.md` template  
**When to use:** First thing in any new project (replaces `qlty init`)  
**Why important:** Enables task tracking and gives you the project planning template

### Step 2: Plan Your Project
1. **Fill out `daddy_project.md`** with your complete vision:
   - What you're building (web app, API, CLI tool)
   - Tech stack preferences (React, Python, etc.)
   - Key features and requirements
   - Add design mockups to `./screenshots/` if you have them

2. **Brainstorm with Claude Code** - Discuss your project, ask questions, research best practices

3. **Review everything** - Make sure your `daddy_project.md` reflects exactly what you want

### Step 3: Generate Your Build Plan
```
/new-project
```
**What it does:** Reads your requirements and creates optimized task sequence  
**When to use:** After your `daddy_project.md` is complete and reviewed  
**Why important:** Creates foundation-first approach with proper dependencies

### Step 4: Build Everything Automatically
```
/start-project  
```
**What it does:** Executes all tasks automatically with validation between each step  
**When to use:** When you're ready to watch AI build your entire project  
**Why amazing:** Professional results without manual coding

## ‚öôÔ∏è Repository Setup (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)

Before using daddy-claude effectively, ensure your repository is properly initialized:

1. **Initialize Git first:**
   ```
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Then run daddy initialization:**
   ```
   daddy init
   ```
   **Why this order matters:** The hey-daddy MCP needs a proper Git repository to track tasks and maintain databases. Without this setup, task management won't work properly.
